                <p>The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley about nine o'clock, going always
                    northeasterly; and at midday reached Reno, where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast.
                </p>

                <p>From this point the road, running along Humboldt River, passed northward for several miles by its
                    banks; then it turned eastward, and kept by the river until it reached the Humboldt Range, nearly at
                    the extreme eastern limit of Nevada.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="tab-2">
                <p>"For one day longer the despatches continued to come from New York. Then they, too, ceased. The man
                    who had sent them, perched in his lofty building, had either died of the plague or been consumed in
                    the great conflagrations he had described as raging around him. And what had occurred in New York
                    had been duplicated in all the other cities. It was the same in San Francisco, and Oakland, and
                    Berkeley. By Thursday the people were dying so rapidly that their corpses could not be handled, and
                    dead bodies lay everywhere. Thursday night the panic outrush for the country began. Imagine, my
                    grandsons, people, thicker than the salmon-run you have seen on the Sacramento river, pouring out of
                    the cities by millions, madly over the country, in vain attempt to escape the ubiquitous death. You
                    see, they carried the germs with them. Even the airships of the rich, fleeing for mountain and
                    desert fastnesses, carried the germs.</p>

                <p>"Hundreds of these airships escaped to Hawaii, and not only did they bring the plague with them, but
                    they found the plague already there before them. This we learned, by the despatches, until all order
                    in San Francisco vanished, and there were no operators left at their posts to receive or send. It
                    was amazing, astounding, this loss of communication with the world. It was exactly as if the world
                    had ceased, been blotted out. For sixty years that world has no longer existed for me. I know there
                    must be such places as New York, Europe, Asia, and Africa; but not one word has been heard of
                    them&mdash;not in sixty years. With the coming of the Scarlet Death the world fell apart,
                    absolutely, irretrievably. Ten thousand years of culture and civilization passed in the twinkling of
                    an eye, 'lapsed like foam.'</p>

                <p>"And what, think you, may have been the fate of the princess, Dejah Thoris?" I asked as casually as
                    possible.</p>

                <p>"She is dead," he answered. "This much was learned from a green warrior recently captured by our
                    forces in the south. She escaped from the hordes of Thark with a strange creature of another world,
                    only to fall into the hands of the Warhoons. Their thoats were found wandering upon the sea bottom
                    and evidences of a bloody conflict were discovered nearby."</p>
